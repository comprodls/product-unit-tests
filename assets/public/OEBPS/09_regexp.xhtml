<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a
problem, think ‘I know, I&#8217;ll use regular expressions.’ Now they have
two problems.</p>
 <footer>Jamie Zawinski</footer>

<p>Programming
tools and techniques survive and spread in a chaotic, evolutionary
way. It&#8217;s not always the pretty or brilliant ones that win but rather
the ones that function well enough within the right niche—for example,
by being integrated with another successful piece of technology.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I will discuss one such
tool, <em>regular expressions</em>. Regular expressions are a way to
describe patterns in string data. They form a small, separate
language that is part of JavaScript and many other languages and
tools.</p>
<p>Regular expressions are both terribly awkward
and extremely useful. Their syntax is cryptic, and the programming
interface JavaScript provides for them is clumsy. But they are a
powerful tool for inspecting and processing strings. Properly
understanding regular expressions will make you a more effective
programmer.</p>
<div id="ch09_sec01">
<h2>Creating a regular expression</h2>
<p>A regular expression is a type of
object. It can either be constructed with the <code>RegExp</code> constructor or
written as a literal value by enclosing the pattern in forward slash
(<code>/</code>) characters.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">re1</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-keyword">new</span> <span class="cm-variable">RegExp</span>(<span class="cm-string">"abc"</span>);
<span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">re2</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string-2">/abc/</span>;</pre>
<p>Both of these regular expression objects represent the same
pattern: an <em>a</em> character followed by a <em>b</em> followed by a <em>c</em>.</p>
<p>When using the
<code>RegExp</code> constructor, the pattern is written as a normal string, so
the usual rules apply for backslashes.</p>
<p>The second notation, where the pattern appears between
slash characters, treats backslashes somewhat differently. First,
since a forward slash ends the pattern, we need to put a backslash
before any forward slash that we want to be <em>part</em> of the pattern. In
addition, backslashes that aren&#8217;t part of special character codes
(like <code>\n</code>) will be <em>preserved</em>, rather than ignored as they are in
strings, and change the meaning of the pattern. Some characters, such
as question marks and plus signs, have special meanings in regular
expressions and must be preceded by a backslash if they are meant to
represent the character itself.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">eighteenPlus</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string-2">/eighteen\+/</span>;</pre>
<p>Knowing precisely what characters to backslash-escape when writing
regular expressions requires you to know every character with a
special meaning. For the time being, this may not be realistic, so
when in doubt, just put a backslash before any character that is not a
letter, number, or whitespace.</p>
</div>
<div id="ch09_sec02">
<h2>Testing for matches</h2>
<p>Regular
expression objects have a number of methods. The simplest one is
<code>test</code>. If you pass it a string, it will return a Boolean telling
you whether the string contains a match of the pattern in the
expression.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/abc/</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"abcde"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → true</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/abc/</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"abxde"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → false</span></pre>
<p>A regular expression consisting of only nonspecial
characters simply represents that sequence of characters. If <em>abc</em>
occurs anywhere in the string we are testing against (not just at the
start), <code>test</code> will return <code>true</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="ch09_sec03">
<h2>Matching a set of characters</h2>
<p>Finding out whether a
string contains <em>abc</em> could just as well be done with a call to
<code>indexOf</code>. Regular expressions allow us to go beyond that and express
more complicated patterns.</p>
<p>Say we want to match any number. In a regular expression, putting
a set of characters between square brackets makes that part of the
expression match any of the characters between the brackets.</p>
<p>Both of the following expressions match all strings that contain a digit:</p>
<pre><span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/[0123456789]/</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"in 1992"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → true</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/[0-9]/</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"in 1992"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → true</span></pre>
<p>Within square brackets, a dash (<code>-</code>) between two
characters can be used to indicate a range of characters, where
the ordering is determined by the character&#8217;s Unicode number.
Characters 0 to 9 sit right next to each other in this ordering
(codes 48 to 57), so <code>[0-9]</code> covers all of them and matches any
digit.</p>
<p>There are a number of common character groups that have
their own built-in shortcuts. Digits are one of them: <code>\d</code> means the
same thing as <code>[0-9]</code>.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><code>\d</code></td>
<td>Any digit character</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>\w</code></td>
<td>An alphanumeric character (“word character”)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>\s</code></td>
<td>Any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, and similar)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>\D</code></td>
<td>A character that is <em>not</em> a digit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>\W</code></td>
<td>A nonalphanumeric character</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>\S</code></td>
<td>A nonwhitespace character</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>.</code></td>
<td>Any character except for newline</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>So you could match a date and time format like 30-01-2003
15:20 with the following expression:</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">dateTime</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string-2">/\d\d-\d\d-\d\d\d\d \d\d:\d\d/</span>;
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">dateTime</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"30-01-2003 15:20"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → true</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">dateTime</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"30-jan-2003 15:20"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → false</span></pre>
<p>That looks completely awful, doesn&#8217;t it? It has way too
many backslashes, producing background noise that makes it hard to
spot the actual pattern expressed. We&#8217;ll see a slightly improved
version of this expression
<a href="09_regexp.xhtml#date_regexp_counted">later</a>.</p>
<p>These
backslash codes can also be used inside square brackets. For
example, <code>[\d.]</code> means any digit or a period character. But note that
the period itself, when used between square brackets, loses its
special meaning. The same goes for other special characters, such as
<code>+</code>.</p>
<p>To <em>invert</em> a
set of characters—that is, to express that you want to match any
character <em>except</em> the ones in the set—you can write a caret (<code>^</code>)
character after the opening bracket.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">notBinary</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string-2">/[^01]/</span>;
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">notBinary</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"1100100010100110"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → false</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">notBinary</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"1100100010200110"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → true</span></pre>
</div>
<div id="ch09_sec04">
<h2>Repeating parts of a pattern</h2>
<p>We now know how to match a single digit. What
if we want to match a whole number—a sequence of one or more
digits?</p>
<p>When you put a
plus sign (<code>+</code>) after something in a regular expression, it indicates
that the element may be repeated more than once. Thus, <code>/\d+/</code> matches
one or more digit characters.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/'\d+'/</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"'123'"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → true</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/'\d+'/</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"''"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → false</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/'\d*'/</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"'123'"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → true</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/'\d*'/</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"''"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → true</span></pre>
<p>The star (<code>*</code>) has a similar
meaning but also allows the pattern to match zero times. Something
with a star after it never prevents a pattern from matching—it&#8217;ll just
match zero instances if it can&#8217;t find any suitable text to match.</p>
<p>A
question mark makes a part of a pattern “optional”, meaning it may
occur zero or one time. In the following example, the <em>u</em> character
is allowed to occur, but the pattern also matches when it is missing.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">neighbor</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string-2">/neighbou?r/</span>;
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">neighbor</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"neighbour"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → true</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">neighbor</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"neighbor"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → true</span></pre>
<p>To indicate that a pattern should
occur a precise number of times, use curly braces. Putting <code>{4}</code> after
an element, for example, requires it to occur exactly four times. It
is also possible to specify a range this way: <code>{2,4}</code> means the
element must occur at least twice and at most four times.</p>
<p id="date_regexp_counted">Here is another version of the date and time pattern that
allows both single- and double-digit days, months, and hours. It
is also slightly more readable.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">dateTime</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string-2">/\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}-\d{4} \d{1,2}:\d{2}/</span>;
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">dateTime</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"30-1-2003 8:45"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → true</span></pre>
<p>You can also specify open-ended ranges when using curly braces by omitting the number on either side of the comma. So
<code>{,5}</code> means zero to five times, and <code>{5,}</code> means five or more times.</p>
</div>
<div id="ch09_sec05">
<h2>Grouping subexpressions</h2>
<p>To use an operator like <code>*</code> or
<code>+</code> on more than one element at a time, you can use parentheses. A
part of a regular expression that is enclosed in parentheses counts
as a single element as far as the operators following it are
concerned.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">cartoonCrying</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string-2">/boo+(hoo+)+/i</span>;
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">cartoonCrying</span>.<span class="cm-property">test</span>(<span class="cm-string">"Boohoooohoohooo"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → true</span></pre>
<p>The first and second <code>+</code> characters apply only to the
second <em>o</em> in <em>boo</em> and <em>hoo</em>, respectively. The third <code>+</code> applies to
the whole group <code>(hoo+)</code>, matching one or more sequences like that.</p>
<p>The <code>i</code> at the end of the expression in the
previous example makes this regular expression case insensitive, allowing it to
match the uppercase <em>B</em> in the input string, even though the pattern
is itself all lowercase.</p>
</div>
<div id="ch09_sec06">
<h2>Matches and groups</h2>
<p>The <code>test</code> method
is the absolute simplest way to match a regular expression. It
tells you only whether it matched and nothing else. Regular expressions
also have an <code>exec</code> (execute) method that will return <code>null</code> if no
match was found and return an object with information about the match
otherwise.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">match</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string-2">/\d+/</span>.<span class="cm-property">exec</span>(<span class="cm-string">"one two 100"</span>);
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">match</span>);
<span class="cm-comment">// → ["100"]</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">match</span>.<span class="cm-property">index</span>);
<span class="cm-comment">// → 8</span></pre>
<p>An object returned from
<code>exec</code> has an <code>index</code> property that tells us <em>where</em> in the string the
successful match begins. Other than that, the object looks like (and
in fact is) an array of strings, whose first element is the string
that was matched—in the previous example, this is the sequence of
digits that we were looking for.</p>
<p>String values have a <code>match</code>
method that behaves similarly.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string">"one two 100"</span>.<span class="cm-property">match</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/\d+/</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → ["100"]</span></pre>
<p>When the regular
expression contains subexpressions grouped with parentheses, the text
that matched those groups will also show up in the array. The whole
match is always the first element. The next element is the part
matched by the first group (the one whose opening parenthesis comes
first in the expression), then the second group, and so on.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">quotedText</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string-2">/'([^']*)'/</span>;
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">quotedText</span>.<span class="cm-property">exec</span>(<span class="cm-string">"she said 'hello'"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → ["'hello'", "hello"]</span></pre>
<p>When a group does not end up being matched at all
(for example, when followed by a question mark), its position in the
output array will hold <code>undefined</code>. Similarly, when a group is matched
multiple times, only the last match ends up in the array.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/bad(ly)?/</span>.<span class="cm-property">exec</span>(<span class="cm-string">"bad"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → ["bad", undefined]</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/(\d)+/</span>.<span class="cm-property">exec</span>(<span class="cm-string">"123"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → ["123", "3"]</span></pre>
<p>Groups can be useful for
extracting parts of a string. If we don&#8217;t just want to verify whether
a string contains a date but also extract it and construct an
object that represents it, we can wrap parentheses around the digit
patterns and directly pick the date out of the result of <code>exec</code>.</p>
<p>But first, a brief detour, in which we discuss the preferred way to
store date and time values in JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<div id="ch09_sec07">
<h2>The date type</h2>
<p>JavaScript has a standard
object type for representing dates—or rather, points in time.
It is called <code>Date</code>. If you simply create a date object using <code>new</code>,
you get the current date and time.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-keyword">new</span> <span class="cm-variable">Date</span>());

<p>You can also create an object for a specific
time.</p>

<p>JavaScript uses a
convention where month numbers start at zero (so December is 11), yet
day numbers start at one. This is confusing and silly. Be careful.</p>
<p>The last four arguments (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds)
are optional and taken to be zero when not given.</p>
<p>Timestamps are stored as the number of
milliseconds since the start of 1970, using negative numbers for
times before 1970 (following a convention set by “Unix time”,
which was invented around that time). The <code>getTime</code> method on a date object
returns this number. It is big, as you can imagine.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-keyword">new</span> <span class="cm-variable">Date</span>(<span class="cm-number">2013</span>, <span class="cm-number">11</span>, <span class="cm-number">19</span>).<span class="cm-property">getTime</span>());

<p>If you give the <code>Date</code>
constructor a single argument, that argument is treated as such
a millisecond count. You can get the current millisecond count by
creating a new <code>Date</code> object and calling <code>getTime</code> on it but also by
calling the <code>Date.now</code> function.</p>
<p>Date objects provide methods like
<code>getFullYear</code>, <code>getMonth</code>, <code>getDate</code>, <code>getHours</code>, <code>getMinutes</code>, and
<code>getSeconds</code> to extract their components. There&#8217;s also <code>getYear</code>,
which gives you a rather useless two-digit year value (such as <code>93</code> or
<code>14</code>).</p>
<p>Putting parentheses around the parts of the
expression that we are interested in, we can now easily create a date
object from a string.</p>

<h2>Word and string boundaries</h2>
<p>Unfortunately,
<code>findDate</code> will also happily extract the nonsensical date 00-1-3000

<p>If we want to

while the dollar sign matches the end. So, <code>/^\d+$/</code> matches a string
consisting entirely of one or more digits, <code>/^!/</code> matches any string
that starts with an exclamation mark, and <code>/x^/</code> does not match any
string (there cannot be an <em>x</em> before the start of the string).</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we just
want to make sure the date starts and ends on a word boundary, we can
use the marker <code>\b</code>. A word boundary can be the start or end of the
string or any point in the string that has a word character (as in
<code>\w</code>) on one side and a nonword character on the other.</p>

<h2>Choice patterns</h2>
<p>Say we want to know whether a piece of text contains not
only a number but a number followed by one of the words <em>pig</em>, <em>cow</em>,
or <em>chicken</em>, or any of their plural forms.</p>
<p>We could write three regular expressions and test them in turn, but
there is a nicer way. The pipe character (<code>|</code>) denotes a
choice between the pattern to its left and the pattern to its
right. So I can say this:</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">animalCount</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string-2">/\b\d+ (pig|cow|chicken)s?\b/</span>;

<span class="cm-comment">// → false</span></pre>
<p>Parentheses can be used to limit the part of the
pattern that the pipe operator applies to, and you can put multiple
such operators next to each other to express a choice between more
than two patterns.</p>

<h2>The mechanics of matching</h2>
<p>Regular

  <img src="img/re_pigchickens.svg" alt="Visualization of /\b\d+ (pig|cow|chicken)s?\b/"/>
</div>
<p>Our expression matches a string if we can find a path
from the left side of the diagram to the right side. We keep
a current position in the string, and every time we move through a
box, we verify that the part of the string after our current position
matches that box.</p>
<p>So if we try to match <code>"the 3 pigs"</code> with our regular expression,
our progress through the flow chart would look like this:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
At position 4, there is a word boundary, so we can move past
   the first box.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Still at position 4, we find a digit, so we can also move past the
   second box.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
At position 5, one path loops back to before the second (digit) box,
   while the other moves forward through the box that holds a single space
   character. There is a space here, not a digit, so we must take the
   second path.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We are now at position 6 (the start of “pigs”) and at the three-way
   branch in the diagram. We don&#8217;t see “cow” or “chicken” here, but we
   do see “pig”, so we take that branch.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
At position 9, after the three-way branch, one path skips
   the <em>s</em> box and goes straight to the final word boundary, while the other path
   matches an <em>s</em>. There is an <em>s</em> character here, not a word boundary,
   so we go through the <em>s</em> box.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We&#8217;re at position 10 (the end of the string) and can match only  a
   word boundary. The end of a string counts as a word boundary,
   so we go through the last box and have successfully matched this
   string.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Conceptually,
a regular expression engine looks for a match in a string as follows:
it starts at the start of the string and tries a match there. In this
case, there <em>is</em> a word boundary there, so it&#8217;d get past the first
box—but there is no digit, so it&#8217;d fail at the second box. Then it
moves on to the second character in the string and tries to begin a
new match there... and so on, until it finds a match or reaches the end
of the string and decides that there really is no match.</p>
</div>
<div id="ch09_sec11">
<h2 id="backtracking">Backtracking</h2>
<p>The regular
expression <code>/\b([01]+b|\d+|[\da-f]+h)\b/</code> matches either a binary
number followed by a <em>b</em>, a regular decimal number with no suffix
character, or a hexadecimal number (that is, base 16, with the letters
<em>a</em> to <em>f</em> standing for the digits 10 to 15) followed by an <em>h</em>. This
is the corresponding diagram:</p>
<div class="image">
  <img src="img/re_number.svg" alt="Visualization of /\b([01]+b|\d+|[\da-f]+h)\b/"/>
</div>
<p>When matching this expression, it will often happen
that the top (binary) branch is entered even though the input does not
actually contain a binary number. When matching the string <code>"103"</code>,
for example, it becomes clear only  at the 3 that we are in the wrong
branch. The string <em>does</em> match the expression, just not the branch we
are currently in.</p>
<p>So the matcher <em>backtracks</em>. When
entering a branch, it remembers its current position (in this
case, at the start of the string, just past the first boundary box in
the diagram) so that it can go back and try another branch if the
current one does not work out. For the string <code>"103"</code>, after
encountering the 3 character, it will start trying the branch for
decimal numbers. This one matches, so a match is reported after all.</p>
<p>The matcher stops as soon as it finds a full
match. This means that if multiple branches could potentially match a
string, only the first one (ordered by where the branches appear in
the regular expression) is used.</p>
<p>Backtracking also happens for repetition operators like + and <code>*</code>.
If you match <code>/^.*x/</code> against <code>"abcxe"</code>, the <code>.*</code> part will first try
to consume the whole string. The engine will then realize that it
needs an <em>x</em> to match the pattern. Since there is no <em>x</em> past the end
of the string, the star operator tries to match one character less.
But the matcher doesn&#8217;t find an <em>x</em> after <code>abcx</code> either, so it
backtracks again, matching the star operator to just <code>abc</code>. <em>Now</em> it
finds an <em>x</em> where it needs it and reports a successful match from
positions 0 to 4.</p>
<p>It is possible to write regular
expressions that will do a <em>lot</em> of backtracking. This problem occurs
when a pattern can match a piece of input in many different ways. For
example, if we get confused while writing a binary-number regular expression, we
might accidentally write something like <code>/([01]+)+b/</code>.</p>
<div class="image">
  <img src="img/re_slow.svg" alt="Visualization of /([01]+)+b/"/>
</div>
<p>If that tries to match some
long series of zeros and ones with no trailing <em>b</em> character, the
matcher will first go through the inner loop until it runs out of
digits. Then it notices there is no <em>b</em>, so it backtracks one
position, goes through the outer loop once, and gives up again, trying
to backtrack out of the inner loop once more. It will continue to try
every possible route through these two loops. This means the amount of
work <em>doubles</em> with each additional character. For even just a few
dozen characters, the resulting match will take practically forever.</p>
</div>
<div id="ch09_sec12">
<h2>The replace method</h2>
<p>String values have a
<code>replace</code> method, which can be used to replace part of the string
with another string.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string">"papa"</span>.<span class="cm-property">replace</span>(<span class="cm-string">"p"</span>, <span class="cm-string">"m"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → mapa</span></pre>
<p>The first
argument can also be a regular expression, in which case the first
match of the regular expression is replaced. When a <code>g</code> option (for
<em>global</em>) is added to the regular expression, <em>all</em> matches in the
string will be replaced, not just the first.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string">"Borobudur"</span>.<span class="cm-property">replace</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/[ou]/</span>, <span class="cm-string">"a"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → Barobudur</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string">"Borobudur"</span>.<span class="cm-property">replace</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/[ou]/g</span>, <span class="cm-string">"a"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → Barabadar</span></pre>
<p>It would have been sensible if the
choice between replacing one match or all matches was made through an
additional argument to <code>replace</code> or by providing a different method,
<code>replaceAll</code>. But for some unfortunate reason, the choice relies on a
property of the regular expression instead.</p>
<p>The real power of using
regular expressions with <code>replace</code> comes from the fact that we can
refer back to matched groups in the replacement string. For example,
say we have a big string containing the names of people, one name per
line, in the format <code>Lastname, Firstname</code>. If we want to swap these
names and remove the comma to get a simple <code>Firstname Lastname</code>
format, we can use the following code:</p>
<pre><span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(
  <span class="cm-string">"Hopper, Grace\nMcCarthy, John\nRitchie, Dennis"</span>
    .<span class="cm-property">replace</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/([\w ]+), ([\w ]+)/g</span>, <span class="cm-string">"$2 $1"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → Grace Hopper</span>
<span class="cm-comment">//   John McCarthy</span>
<span class="cm-comment">//   Dennis Ritchie</span></pre>
<p>The <code>$1</code> and <code>$2</code> in the replacement string refer to the parenthesized
groups in the pattern. <code>$1</code> is replaced by the text that matched
against the first group, <code>$2</code> by the second, and so on, up to <code>$9</code>.
The whole match can be referred to with <code>$&amp;</code>.</p>
<p>It is also
possible to pass a function, rather than a string, as the second
argument to <code>replace</code>. For each replacement, the function will be
called with the matched groups (as well as the whole match) as
arguments, and its return value will be inserted into the new string.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a simple example:</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">s</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string">"the cia and fbi"</span>;

}));
<span class="cm-comment">// → the CIA and FBI</span></pre>
<p>And here&#8217;s a more interesting one:</p>

<p>This takes a string, finds all occurrences of a number followed by an
alphanumeric word, and returns a string wherein every such occurrence
is decremented by one.</p>
<p>The <code>(\d+)</code> group ends up as the <code>amount</code> argument to the function,
and the <code>(\w+)</code> group gets bound to <code>unit</code>. The function converts
<code>amount</code> to a number—which always works, since it matched <code>\d+</code>—and
makes some adjustments in case there is only one or zero left.</p>

<div id="ch09_sec13">
<h2>Greed</h2>
<p>It isn&#8217;t hard to use <code>replace</code> to
write a function that removes all comments from a piece of
JavaScript code. Here is a first attempt:</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">function</span> <span class="cm-variable">stripComments</span>(<span class="cm-def">code</span>) {
  <span class="cm-keyword">return</span> <span class="cm-variable-2">code</span>.<span class="cm-property">replace</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/\/\/.*|\/\*[^]*\*\//g</span>, <span class="cm-string">""</span>);
}
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">stripComments</span>(<span class="cm-string">"1 + /* 2 */3"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → 1 + 3</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">stripComments</span>(<span class="cm-string">"x = 10;// ten!"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → x = 10;</span>
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">stripComments</span>(<span class="cm-string">"1 /* a */+/* b */ 1"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → 1  1</span></pre>
<p>The
part before the <em>or</em> operator simply matches two slash characters
followed by any number of non-newline characters. The part for
multiline comments is more involved. We use <code>[^]</code> (any character that
is not in the empty set of characters) as a way to match any
character. We cannot just use a dot here because block comments can
continue on a new line, and dots do not match the newline character.</p>
<p>But the output of the previous example appears to have gone wrong. Why?</p>
<p>The <code>[^]*</code> part of
the expression, as I described in the section on backtracking, will
first match as much as it can. If that causes the next part of the
pattern to fail, the matcher moves back one character and tries again
from there. In the example, the matcher first tries to match the whole
rest of the string and then moves back from there. It will find an
occurrence of <code>*/</code> after going back four characters and match that.
This is not what we wanted—the intention was to match a single
comment, not to go all the way to the end of the code and find the end
of the last block comment.</p>
<p>Because of this behavior, we say the repetition operators (<code>+</code>, <code>*</code>,
<code>?</code>, and <code>{}</code>) are <em>greedy</em>, meaning they match as much as they
can and backtrack from there. If you put a question mark after
them (<code>+?</code>, <code>*?</code>, <code>??</code>, <code>{}?</code>), they become nongreedy and start by
matching as little as possible, matching more only when the remaining
pattern does not fit the smaller match.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what we want in this case. By having the star
match the smallest stretch of characters that brings us to a <code>*/</code>,
we consume one block comment and nothing more.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">function</span> <span class="cm-variable">stripComments</span>(<span class="cm-def">code</span>) {
  <span class="cm-keyword">return</span> <span class="cm-variable-2">code</span>.<span class="cm-property">replace</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/\/\/.*|\/\*[^]*?\*\//g</span>, <span class="cm-string">""</span>);
}
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">stripComments</span>(<span class="cm-string">"1 /* a */+/* b */ 1"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → 1 + 1</span></pre>
<p>A lot of bugs in regular expression programs can be traced to
unintentionally using a greedy operator where a nongreedy one would
work better. When using a repetition operator, consider the
nongreedy variant first.</p>

<h2>Dynamically creating RegExp objects</h2>
<p>There are cases where you might not know the exact
pattern you need to match against when you are writing your code.
Say you want to look for the user&#8217;s name in a piece of text and
enclose it in underscore characters to make it stand out. Since you
will know the name only once the program is actually running, you
can&#8217;t use the slash-based notation.</p>
<p>But you can build up a string and use the <code>RegExp</code> constructor on
that. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">name</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string">"harry"</span>;
<span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">text</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string">"Harry is a suspicious character."</span>;
<span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">regexp</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-keyword">new</span> <span class="cm-variable">RegExp</span>(<span class="cm-string">"\\b("</span> <span class="cm-operator">+</span> <span class="cm-variable">name</span> <span class="cm-operator">+</span> <span class="cm-string">")\\b"</span>, <span class="cm-string">"gi"</span>);
<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">text</span>.<span class="cm-property">replace</span>(<span class="cm-variable">regexp</span>, <span class="cm-string">"_$1_"</span>));
<span class="cm-comment">// → _Harry_ is a suspicious character.</span></pre>
<p>When creating
the <code>\b</code> boundary markers, we have to use two backslashes because
we are writing them in a normal string, not a slash-enclosed regular
expression. The second argument to the <code>RegExp</code> constructor contains
the options for the regular expression—in this case <code>"gi"</code> for global
and case-insensitive.</p>
<p>But what if the name is <code>"dea+hl[]rd"</code> because our user is a nerdy
teenager? That would result in a nonsensical regular expression, which
won&#8217;t actually match the user&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>To work around this, we can add backslashes
before any character that we don&#8217;t trust. Adding backslashes before
alphabetic characters is a bad idea because things like <code>\b</code> and <code>\n</code>
have a special meaning. But escaping everything that&#8217;s not
alphanumeric or whitespace is safe.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">name</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string">"dea+hl[]rd"</span>;

<h2>The search method</h2>
<p>The <code>indexOf</code> method on strings cannot be
called with a regular expression. But there is another method,
<code>search</code>, which does expect a regular expression. Like <code>indexOf</code>, it
returns the first index on which the expression was found, or -1 when
it wasn&#8217;t found.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string">"  word"</span>.<span class="cm-property">search</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/\S/</span>));

<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to indicate that the match should start
at a given offset (like we can with the second argument to <code>indexOf</code>),
which would often be useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="ch09_sec16">
<h2>The lastIndex property</h2>
<p>The <code>exec</code> method similarly
does not provide a convenient way to start searching from a given
position in the string. But it does provide an <em>in</em>convenient way.</p>
<p>Regular expression objects have
properties. One such property is <code>source</code>, which contains the string
that expression was created from. Another property is <code>lastIndex</code>,
which controls, in some limited circumstances, where the next match
will start.</p>
<p>Those circumstances are that the regular
expression must have the global (<code>g</code>) option enabled, and the match
must happen through the <code>exec</code> method. Again, a more sane solution
would have been to just allow an extra argument to be passed to
<code>exec</code>, but sanity is not a defining characteristic of JavaScript&#8217;s
regular expression interface.</p>

<p>If the match was successful,
the call to <code>exec</code> automatically updates the <code>lastIndex</code> property to
point after the match. If no match was found, <code>lastIndex</code> is set back
to zero, which is also the value it has in a newly constructed regular
expression object.</p>
<p>When using a global regular expression value for multiple
<code>exec</code> calls, these automatic updates to the <code>lastIndex</code> property can
cause problems. Your regular expression might be accidentally starting
at an index that was left over from a previous call.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">digit</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string-2">/\d/g</span>;

<p>Another interesting
effect of the global option is that it changes the way the <code>match</code>
method on strings works. When called with a global expression, instead
of returning an array similar to that returned by <code>exec</code>, <code>match</code> will
find <em>all</em> matches of the pattern in the string and return an array
containing the matched strings.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-string">"Banana"</span>.<span class="cm-property">match</span>(<span class="cm-string-2">/an/g</span>));

<p>So be cautious with global regular expressions. The cases where they
are necessary—calls to <code>replace</code> and places where you want to
explicitly use <code>lastIndex</code>—are typically the only places where you
want to use them.</p>
<h3>Looping over matches</h3>
<p>A common pattern is
to scan through all occurrences of a pattern in a string, in a way
that gives us access to the match object in the loop body, by using
<code>lastIndex</code> and <code>exec</code>.</p>
<pre><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-variable">input</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-string">"A string with 3 numbers in it... 42 and 88."</span>;

<p>This makes use of the fact that the
value of an assignment expression (<code>=</code>) is the assigned value. So
by using <code>match = number.exec(input)</code> as the condition in the <code>while</code>
statement, we perform the match at the start of each iteration, save
its result in a variable, and stop looping when no more matches
are found.</p>

<p>To
conclude the chapter, we&#8217;ll look at a problem that calls for regular expressions. Imagine we are writing a program to automatically
harvest information about our enemies from the Internet. (We will
not actually write that program here, just the part that reads the
configuration file. Sorry to disappoint.) The configuration file
looks like this:</p>
<pre>searchengine=http://www.google.com/search?q=$1
spitefulness=9.7

; comments are preceded by a semicolon...
; each section concerns an individual enemy
[larry]
fullname=Larry Doe
type=kindergarten bully
website=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/11451

[gargamel]
fullname=Gargamel
type=evil sorcerer
outputdir=/home/marijn/enemies/gargamel</pre>
<p>The exact rules for this format (which is actually a
widely used format, usually called an <em>INI</em> file) are as follows:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Blank lines and lines starting with semicolons are ignored.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Lines wrapped in <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> start a new section.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Lines containing an alphanumeric identifier followed by an <code>=</code>
  character add a setting to the current section.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Anything else is invalid.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Our task is to convert a string like this into an array of objects,
each with a <code>name</code> property and an array of settings. We&#8217;ll need one
such object for each section and one for the global settings at the
top.</p>
<p>Since the
format has to be processed line by line, splitting up the file
into separate lines is a good start. We used <code>string.split("\n")</code> to
do this in <a href="06_object.xhtml#split">Chapter 6</a>. Some operating
systems, however, use not just a newline character to separate lines
but a carriage return character followed by a newline (<code>"\r\n"</code>).
Given that the <code>split</code> method also allows a regular expression as its
argument, we can split on a regular expression like <code>/\r?\n/</code> to split
in a way that allows both <code>"\n"</code> and <code>"\r\n"</code> between lines.</p>

<p>This code goes over every line in
the file, updating the “current section” object as it goes along.
First, it checks whether the line can be ignored, using the expression
<code>/^\s*(;.*)?$/</code>. Do you see how it works? The part between the
parentheses will match comments, and the <code>?</code> will make sure it
also matches lines containing only whitespace.</p>
<p>If the line is not a comment, the code then checks whether the
line starts a new section. If so, it creates a new current section
object, to which subsequent settings will be added.</p>
<p>The last meaningful possibility is that the line is a normal setting,
which the code adds to the current section object.</p>
<p>If a line matches none of these forms, the function throws an
error.</p>
<p>Note the recurring
use of <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> to make sure the expression matches the whole line,
not just part of it. Leaving these out results in code that mostly
works but behaves strangely for some input, which can be a difficult
bug to track down.</p>
<p>The pattern <code>if (match
= string.match(...))</code> is similar to the trick of using an assignment
as the condition for <code>while</code>. You often aren&#8217;t sure that your call to
<code>match</code> will succeed, so you can  access the resulting object only
inside an <code>if</code> statement that tests for this. To not break the
pleasant chain of <code>if</code> forms, we assign the result of the match to a
variable and immediately use that assignment as the test in the <code>if</code>
statement.</p>

<h2>International characters</h2>
<p>Because of JavaScript&#8217;s initial
simplistic implementation and the fact that this simplistic approach
was later set in stone as standard behavior, JavaScript&#8217;s regular
expressions are rather dumb about characters that do not appear in the
English language. For example, as far as JavaScript&#8217;s regular
expressions are concerned, a “word character” is only one of the
26 characters in the Latin alphabet (uppercase or lowercase) and, for
some reason, the underscore character. Things like <em>é</em> or <em>β</em>, which
most definitely are word characters, will not match <code>\w</code> (and <em>will</em>
match uppercase <code>\W</code>, the nonword category).</p>
<p>By a strange historical accident, <code>\s</code> (whitespace)
does not have this problem and matches all characters that the
Unicode standard considers whitespace, including things like the
nonbreaking space and the Mongolian vowel separator.</p>
<p>Some regular expression
implementations in other programming languages have syntax to
match specific Unicode character categories, such as “all
uppercase letters”, “all punctuation”, or “control characters”. There
are plans to add support for such categories JavaScript, but it
unfortunately looks like they won&#8217;t be realized in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="summary_regexp">Summary</h2>

<p>A regular expression has a method <code>test</code> to test whether a given
string matches it. It also has an <code>exec</code> method that, when a match is
found, returns an array containing all matched groups. Such an array
has an <code>index</code> property that indicates where the match started.</p>
<p>Strings have a <code>match</code> method to match them against a regular
expression and a <code>search</code> method to search for one, returning only the
starting position of the match. Their <code>replace</code> method can replace
matches of a pattern with a replacement string. Alternatively, you can
pass a function to <code>replace</code>, which will be used to build up a
replacement string based on the match text and matched groups.</p>
<p>Regular expressions can have options, which are written after
the closing slash. The <code>i</code> option makes the match case insensitive,
while the <code>g</code> option makes the expression <em>global</em>, which, among other
things, causes the <code>replace</code> method to replace all instances instead
of just the first.</p>
<p>The <code>RegExp</code> constructor can be used to create a regular expression
value from a string.</p>
<p>Regular expressions are a sharp tool with an awkward handle. They
simplify some tasks tremendously but can quickly become unmanageable
when applied to complex problems. Part of knowing how to use them is
resisting the urge to try to shoehorn things that they cannot sanely
express into them.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p>It is almost unavoidable that, in the course
of working on these exercises, you will get confused and frustrated by
some regular expression&#8217;s inexplicable behavior. Sometimes it
helps to enter your expression into an online tool like
<a href="https://www.debuggex.com/"><em>debuggex.com</em></a> to see whether its
visualization corresponds to what you intended and to experiment
with the way it responds to various input strings.</p>
<h3>Regexp golf</h3>
<p><em>Code
golf</em> is a term used for the game of trying to express a particular
program in as few characters as possible. Similarly, <em>regexp golf</em> is
the practice of writing as tiny a regular expression as possible to
match a given pattern, and <em>only</em> that pattern.</p>
<p>For each of the following items, write a regular expression to test whether any of the given substrings occur in a
string. The regular expression should match only strings containing
one of the substrings described. Do not worry about word boundaries
unless explicitly mentioned. When your expression works, see whether you
can make it any smaller.</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
<em>car</em> and <em>cat</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>pop</em> and <em>prop</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>ferret</em>, <em>ferry</em>, and <em>ferrari</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Any word ending in <em>ious</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A whitespace character followed by a dot, comma, colon, or semicolon

A word without the letter <em>e</em>
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>Refer to the table in the
<a href="09_regexp.xhtml#summary_regexp">chapter summary</a> for help. Test each
solution with a few test strings.</p>
<h3>Quoting style</h3>
<p>Imagine you have written a
story and used single quotation marks throughout to mark pieces
of dialogue. Now you want to replace all the dialogue quotes with
double quotes, while keeping the single quotes used in contractions
like <em>aren&#8217;t</em>.</p>
<p>Think of a pattern that distinguishes these two
kinds of quote usage and craft a call to the <code>replace</code> method that
does the proper replacement.</p>
<h3>Numbers again</h3>
<p>A series of digits can be matched by the simple
regular expression <code>/\d+/</code>.</p>
<p>Write an expression that matches only JavaScript-style
numbers. It must support an optional minus <em>or</em> plus sign in front of
the number, the decimal dot, and exponent notation—<code>5e-3</code> or <code>1E10</code>—
again with an optional sign in front of the exponent. Also note that
it is not necessary for there to be digits in front of or after the
dot, but the number cannot be a dot alone. That is, <code>.5</code> and <code>5.</code>
are valid JavaScript numbers, but a lone dot <em>isn&#8217;t</em>.</p>
